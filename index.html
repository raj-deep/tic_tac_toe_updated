            The Game contains 9 big blocks, and each of them again contains 9
            smaller blocks which are to be filled with either "o" or "x".
          </li>
          <li>
            When a player marks a smaller block within a larger block, the next
            player must mark a block within the corresponding larger block.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, if a player marks the 5th smaller block of the 1st
            larger block, the next player must mark any block within the 5th
            larger block.
          </li>
          <li>
            A larger block is considered occupied when a player wins the
            tic-tac-toe game within that larger block, and all the smaller block
            will become disabled for the rest of the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player got their chance in a larger block that is already
            occupied, then the whole board will become available for the
            markings.
          </li>
